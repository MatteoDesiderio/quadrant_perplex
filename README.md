This is a simple python (?) script to

* Define a number of quadrants in the PT space
* Create a project dat file for each of these quadrants (without BUILD)
* Run VERTEX in each of these automating the input and possibly parallelizing
* Automating UNSPLT690 if possible and automating WERAMI

If the last point is not possible, alternatively
* Automating WERAMI to compute the properties in these PT quadrants
* Joining the tab files thus created

The dir_ing directory contains my own tests
